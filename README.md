 
# MCP Raw Texture Project – Part 1

This repository contains **Part 1 of an academic exploration of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, developed during an AI bootcamp.

The focus of this part was on:
- understanding the MCP server structure,
- implementing basic MCP tools,
- experimenting with domain-specific logic related to raw textures.

This repository represents an **early and exploratory stage** of the MCP work.

More advanced orchestration and planning logic was developed separately in **Part 2**.
