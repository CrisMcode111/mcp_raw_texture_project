# MCP Raw Texture Project – Part 1

This repository contains **Part 1 of an academic exploration of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, developed during an AI bootcamp.

The purpose of this part was to:
- understand the basics of MCP clients and servers,
- connect to existing third-party MCP servers,
- discover and call exposed tools,
- experiment with simple LLM-guided interactions.

This work represents an **early and exploratory stage** of the MCP learning process.

---

## Scope

In this part:
- no custom MCP server is built,
- no advanced orchestration logic is implemented,
- experimentation is primarily notebook-based (Colab / Jupyter).

The focus is on **understanding MCP fundamentals and tool interaction**, not on building a production-ready agent.

---

## Relation to Part 2

More advanced work — including:
- a custom MCP server,
- multi-file Python structure,
- orchestration and planning logic —

was developed separately in **Part 2**.
